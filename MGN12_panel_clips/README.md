# MGN12 Panel Clips

I had a stack of MGN12 linear rails of suitable length spare, so a quick search
led to remixes of various parts to allow operation with the MGN12 rails.

However the carriage of the rails are wider, which means the side panels need 5mm
thick foam instead of 1mm thick. This extra 4mm requires different clips.

I was also not able to source 1mm foam tape for the oither panels so I got 2mm
instead. Hence the other set of clips.

## Stacking

The side panels have 5mm foam tape plus 3mm acrylic panels, giving an 8mm stack.
I took off 0.5mm to provide some clamping force, giving 7.5mm.

The other panels have 2mm foam tape plus 3mm acrylic panels, giving a 5mm stack.
I took off 0.5mm to provide some clamping force, giving 4.5mm.

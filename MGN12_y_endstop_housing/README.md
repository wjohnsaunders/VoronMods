# MGN12 Y Endstop Housing

This houses the Y endstop microswitch when you don't use the cable chain setup.
It is attached underneath the A motor mount and is contacted by the linear rail
carriage.

I had a stack of MGN12 linear rails of suitable length spare, so a quick search
led to remixes of various parts to allow operation with the MGN12 rails.

The MGN12 rails are 2mm taller than MGN9, so the stock housing positioned the
microswitch too low and the lever was fouling on the rail. This modified
housing lower the microswitch 2mm restoring the correct alignment.

## Printing

Print as-is. This part requires some bridging for internal surfaces and they
come out the same as printing the stock part.

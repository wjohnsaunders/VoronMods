# MGN12 Z Rail Stops

I had a stack of MGN12 linear rails of suitable length spare, so a quick search
led to remixes of various parts to allow operation with the MGN12 rails.

The MGN12 rails are taller and wider than MGN9, so I re-designed the rail stop
to be compatible with the MGN12 rails.

Not that the stock rail stops actually work OK, however this mount makes them
flush with the rails and gives a better appearance compared to the undersized
stops.

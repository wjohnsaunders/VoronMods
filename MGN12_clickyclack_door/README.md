# MGN12 ClickClack Door Mod

I had a stack of MGN12 linear rails of suitable length spare, so a quick search
led to remixes of various parts to allow operation with the MGN12 rails.

However the carriage of the rails are wider, which means the side panels need 5mm
thick foam instead of 1mm thick. This extra 4mm protuding from the side interferes
with the handle and latch.

This remix spaces the door handles and latch 4mm away from the extrusion giving it
the clearance needed.

## Printing

The top and bottom handle hinges need to be flipped upside down in order to print.
I could possibly fix this in the CAD file at some point, but for now they need to
be flipped.

The latch prints on its end like in the original files.
